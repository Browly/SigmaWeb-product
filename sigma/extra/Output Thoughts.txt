This block of code is all the client inputs?

Ideas: Have it save their inputs? How do I do that? Create a data file with it and read it everytime or store it as a variable? 

What will be the default value for these inputs

Things to output

Average waiting time. 
# of customers servers	: 
# of cupcakes served 	: TOTAL[1]
# profit. No one cares about anything else. Lol. 


Notes from Soroush
Option to adjust number of replications, and also number of days.
Options for Confidence 

how many times they want to run. 
Find the baseline. 
1. Confidence histogram for 5% and try to improve off of it
2. Compare everything to that. 
3. Default is around 100. 

4. Turn off the trace events to make it run faster. 
5. Want histrogram want target chart and sensitivity analysis. 
6. 

Need to create a huge function. 
Create a scatter plot take the average. And see how it compares to the 
y-axis KPI
x-axis what we modified. And we see what messes up. 

Extract all the data from the input file.
	1. User puts in inputs
	2. Create a datafile from this.
	3. Run simulation to find baseline.
	4. Start sensitivity analysis. 
	5. Go into data file. 

	Run a target with this many steps.
	I want 1-10 moer of these resources
	I want 10% decrement until I see a platue. 

Figure out how to add another website to the thing. 
Create an interactive beta distribution page? 
	How do customer arrivals be? a poisson process. 
	Beta is for how long something takes.
